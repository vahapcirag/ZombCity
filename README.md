# ZombCity 

Thanks for checking in. The project is a simple Top-down horde* shooter. There is a local network support implemented.
It is a co-op 2-player game. The amount of zombies and their health increases over the waves. And, there's a well-balanced
loot chest system which spawns more and more frequent according to the progress you've made. 

The reasons for the warnings are:
1- UNET, since it will be removed soon.
2- I declared the variables as private and added SerializedField attributes.

Unity Vesion: 
  2018.4.4F1 (2019.1 doesn't support UNET)

Preview Packages:
  2D Animation
  2D IK
  2D PSD Importer

*: A horde game is an unpopular gamemode which consists of waves of enemies that get increasingly harder, one of the most poplar
examples is CoD: Zombies

P.S: The project is left unfinished, since UNET is outdated and impractical.
